## Support Email 1
**Subject:** Cannot login to my account

Help!

I've been trying to login for the past hour but keep getting "Invalid credentials" error. I'm 100% sure my password is correct. I've tried resetting it twice but still can't get in.

Please help urgently.

## Support Email 2
**Subject:** Bug Report - Dashboard not loading

Hi Support,

I'm experiencing a technical issue. The dashboard page shows a blank white screen after the latest update. I've tried:
- Clearing cache
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox)
- Incognito mode

Nothing works. This is blocking my work.

Thanks,
Lisa Park

## Support Email 3
**Subject:** Refund Request - Service not working

Hello,

I purchased the Pro plan last week but the main feature I needed (PDF export) doesn't work at all. I get an error every time.

I'd like a refund as the product doesn't work as advertised. Please process this immediately.

**Subject:** How do I cancel my subscription?

Hi,

I need to cancel my subscription before the next billing cycle. I can't find the cancellation option anywhere in my account settings.

Can you please help me cancel or point me to where I can do this?

Thanks,
